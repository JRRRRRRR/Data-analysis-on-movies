# Phase-1-Project
Data analysis on movies
# Introduction
Using the knowledge and skills we learned in phase 1 to analyze the movies' data. Below is the Business description:
* Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
After reviewing the dataset, I make a plan for this problem.
# Plan
1. Best Genre
    * The best genre in Highest Mean Rating 
    * The best genre in Highest Total Gross(two resources)
    * Comparing and Summary
2. Budget vs Total Grosses
    * Are budgets and total grosses connected?
    * Which genre has the strongest relationship between budgets and total grosses?
    * Which genre has the highest revenue(with budget information)?
3. Best Runtime 
    * Find the most runtime range from top rating movies 
    * Find the most runtime range from top revenue movies
    * Comparing and Summary
* I will tell the company which genre, which budget, and which runtime will be best for a movie with expected revenue.
# Technics
* Data collecting, Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, and Visualization are all in the Jupyter Notebook.
* A PowerPoint all pdf for presentation
* A 5 minutes recording to review
* https://youtu.be/XeUthfAOI2k
# Future Work
* If I have more time, I will dig the studio date.
* I will find the best studio by showing the average rating and revenue of all their movies.
# Summary
It is a nice experience to handle all the procedures myslef. Also, I learned a lot of knowledge from movies, not only just watching movies.
All the data analysis gives the company a review of the movie industry. At last, I make some recommendations for them.
